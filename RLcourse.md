## about the RL
强化学习是不同学科交叉的产物，本质上是一门决策科学
计算机科学
工程领域
数学

机器学习的分支：监督学习，无监督学习，强化学习

强化学习特点
- only a reward signal
- feedback是delayed，不是instantaneous
- time realy matters（seqential data，non iid）
- agents的action影响接下来他收到的数据

## the RL problem
### Rewards
A reward $R_t$ is a scalar feedback signal，the agent's job is to maximize
cumulative reward.

RL is based on the reward hypothesis  

## Inside An RL Agent

## problem within RL
- Learning and Planning, two fundamental problems in suquential decision making
- RL
  - the env is initially unknown
  - the agent interacts with the env
  - the agent improves its Policy
- Planning
  - a model of the env is known
  - the agent performs computations with its model(without any external interaction)
  - the agent improves its policy
